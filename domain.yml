  utter_happy:
  - text: Great, carry on!
  utter_goodbye:
  - text: Bye
  utter_iamabot:
  - text: I am a bot, powered by Rasa.
  utter_f6l_location:
  - text: We currently have five offices in Cairo, Jeddah, Abu Dhabi, Beirut, and
      Tunis. However, we have expansion plans in the very near future.
  utter_f6l_sectors:
  - text: 'Flat6Labs is sector agnostic and does not invest in one industry. However
      preference is given to startups in the following sectors: ICT, Healthcare, Education,
      Digital Content and Media, Consumer Internet (Marketplaces, e-Commerce), and
      FinTech.'
  utter_f6l_office:
  - text: We ask all core team members to work from our Flat6Labs office, so we can
      closely work with them and support them with the advice and mentorship they
      need to accelerate and grow. However many startups have part time employees
      who don’t need to be in the accelerator.
  utter_f6l_sameidea:
  - text: We do our best to select diversified ideas during each cycle, but if this
      scenario happens or if any team changes the scope during the cycle, we will
      always look for ways of cooperation between the concerned teams rather than
      pitting them against each other. This should be easy, especially since there
      is no way any two ideas can be that identical in the world of technology.
  utter_f6l_stake:
  - text: Upon joining Flat6Labs, we acquire a 10% stake of equity in the company.
  utter_f6l_graduation:
  - text: It denotes the time when the 4-month cycle ends and teams have to acquire
      a premises other than Flat6Labs. However, by no means whatsoever does this mean
      that our services are discontinued to our startups.
  utter_f6l_changescope:
  - text: You can change scope as long as the new scope is agreed upon by all stakeholders.
  utter_f6l_contactme:
  - text: It usually takes few weeks to process every application and contact you
      for an interview. If you think it has been taking too long, or something may
      have gone wrong, please send us an email to apply@flat6labs.com (based on location
      you are applying to) to ensure that everything is in order.
  utter_f6l_twoideas:
  - text: You can apply twice, with one idea per application.
  utter_f6l_morefund:
  - text: Our offering range is the same for all teams, and we believe that very few
      early stage startups need more money to go through a 4 month accelerator. Follow-on
      funding can be targeted from VCs and Angel investors following demo day which
      we will support you in sourcing.
  utter_f6l_selection:
  - text: We assess startups based on the fact that they have a strong team, an interesting
      opportunity with a clear need and a large market, and an innovation that they
      are introducing - in other words not simply copying another startup.
  utter_f6l_fund:
  - text: Accepted startups receive  EGP 500-750k in cash seed funding and up to EGP2m
      in follow-on funding.
  utter_f6l_startups#:
  - text: We invest in 10 startups per cycle and we have 2 cycles each year, so we
      generally invest in around 20 startups each year.
  utter_f6l_plan:
  - text: No, we don’t ask for a business plan for applying to Flat6Labs, but we encourage
      all our teams to have an idea of how they plan to make money, and how they plan
      to grow when they apply when they come to interview.
